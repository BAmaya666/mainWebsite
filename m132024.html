                        <p>Kolb’s learning cycle is an integrated process (do something, take a step back and reflect, then present what you just learned and do it with previous knowledge) with the intention of creating a mental model of the learner. These are the four stages of the cycle:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><em>Concrete experience.</em> The learner encounters a concrete experience.</li>
                            <li><em>Reflective observation.</em> The learner takes a step back to look at the bigger picture and reflect.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tools for this stage can include asking questions and sharing observations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><em>Abstract Conceptualization.</em> The learner makes sense of what they just experienced, pulls ideas that they are already familiar with, and fits the new knowledge into what they already know.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Presenting ideas in a paper can be a good tool.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>And active experimentation is when the learner puts into practice the new ideas that develop from reflecting on the previous experience.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="headScript">

                            <p>Kolb’s learning theory diagram</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The learning styles are based on two dimensions: doing (active experimentation) and watching( reflective observation) as the x axis, and thinking (the abstract conceptualization) and feeling (having a concrete experience) as the y axis. The x axis refers to how we approach the tasks (the processing continuum), and the y axis refers to how we feel about the task (the perception continuum).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Diverging.</b> The people that fall into this category can see things from different perspectives, prefer to watch rather than do, <b><em>collect information, and solve problems mentally</em></b> (brainstorming). This learner <b><em>likes to work in groups</em></b>, takes feedback well, and is interested in people.</li>
                            <li><b>Assimilating.</b> Likes ideas more than the people side of things. Logical problem solver. interested in the logic of the theory rather than the practical application. Software engineers and scientists.<br />
                            Assimilation of new knowledge needs to be concise, with a logical approach. These people require good, clear explanations rather than a practical opportunity. <b><em>They excel at understanding wide-ranging information and organizing it in a clear, logical format.</em></b> They are attracted to logical theories based on practical value. <br />In formal learning situations, people with this style prefer readings, lectures, exploring analytical models, and having time to think things through.</li>
                            <li><b>Converging.</b> These learners are best at finding practical uses for ideas and theories and prefer technical tasks. They often work as technical experts.<br />
                            They focus on <b><em>experimenting</em></b> with new ideas and <b><em>working with practical applications.</em></b></li>
                            <li><b>Accomodating.</b> Prefer learning through doing. These learners use other people’s analysis and prefer to take a practical approach.<br />
                            <b><em>They take initiative, set goals and actively work to achieve them</em></b>, even if that means relying on their ‘gut’ instinct rather than analysis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>⚠️⚠️⚠️ <b>It is important to note that this learning theory is widely criticized because learning is not as simple and the learner may have more learning styles.</b> I believe it’s a good tool to have a consideration still, to have a foundation to start with.</p>
                        <p>I took <a href="https://en.eduolog.com/test/kolbs-learning-styles-test/">a test</a>, and my profile came out as more inclined toward abstract conceptualization (thinking) and reflective observation (watching).</p>

                        <h3 id="pomodoro">The Pomodoro Technique</h3>
                        <p>The technique was invented by Francesco Cirilo, and he came up with this time management method by setting time intervals with a tomato (pomodoro) clock in his kitchen.</p>
                        <p><em>This method gets you into the task as it gets you into its momentum, so it’s great for when you have a lack of motivation. and it promises you that <b>it will reduce the anxiety of time pressure.</b></em></p>
                        <p>It might not be the best when your work requires communication with dozens of people, but you might want to <b>gather all the information from your meetings and the social part of your work and put it in place with this technique</b> in a calm environment.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First of all, you need to <b>have everything you need to work on your tasks’ sessions</b>. Ask yourself: What will be the things I’m studying or working on? today. Choose the task: In what order am I going to work them? How much time (how many pomodoro seesions) I’m going to give to the task?</li>
                            <li>Plan your tasks in chunks; do not multitask.</li>
                            <li>Set the timer for 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes for a break (1 pomodoro session). There are apps on your phone and computer to do this more effectively. Right now, I’m using the pomodoro timer on <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">Pomofocus</a> on my computer. It does the work.</li>
                            <li>After 5 pomodoros, take a longer break of 20–30 minutes. And repeat the whole process.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now, to make it work, <b>limit distractions</b> by removing all unnecessary items from your desk that might distract you, such as your phone, snacks, and toys. Also, music harms your deep focus, but if you need to isolate yourself from a noisy environment, background music (like ambient, soundtracks, electronic, and lo-fi music) can work.</p>
                        <p>Consider that <b>it’s just a tool</b>, so be flexible with yourself. If you finished the first chunk of work and still have time, move to the next chunk. If you are out of time in the session and you’re enjoying yourself doing the task, <b>don’t break the flow.</b> This is the first time I’m using it, and I’m working more than 25 minutes before my break because I’m in the momentum.</p>
                        <p>There are also ways to have <b>better breaks to improve your focus, by changing your mental activity into a physical one</b>, like going outside, doing exercise, eating a healthy snack, practicing meditation, and cleaning up.</p>
                        <p><b>Gamifying your method</b> might also help and make it more exciting. <a href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica</a> on Android makes this possible.</p>

                        <p>I was looking for a specific YouTube video where I took notes about this topic back when I was learning HTML and JavaScript. but I couldn’t find it. But these were my scattered notes</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Read the problem several times until you can explain it to someone else.</li>
                            <li>Solve the problem manually. That way, you know exactly what you want to automate as you move forward.</li>
                            <li><b>Write pseudocode</b> (like human-like language) for the task you want to do:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Display “Enter the first number:"</li>
                                <li>Input the first number from the user and store it in a variable called num1</li>
                                <li>Display “Enter the second number:"</li>
                                <li>Input the second number from the user and store it in a variable called num2</li>
                                <li>Add num1 and num2 together and store the result in a variable called sum</li>
                                <li>Display “The sum of ” + num1 + ” and ” + num2 + “is ” + sum</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Replace pseudo code with real code:</li>

                        <p>But in general, what the videos I watched have in common is to get yourself some time away from the computer (e.g., go for a 30-minute walk) and break the problem into small chunks.</p>
                        <p>Other tips are to do one small thing you can do right to build confidence and to <b>make a list</b> of all the chunks of the problem to <b>check them off as you solve them.</b></p>
                        <p>And when you are running out of time, let’s say you tried to fix it yourself for 2 hours. Ask for help! Present your trouble <b>with a clear sentence</b>: “I have trouble fixing <em>this.</em>” Here’s my research for <em>this.</em>” and a clear question.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="why">The 5 Whys analysis</h3>
                        <p>Don Norman also talks about it in the Toyota Production chapter.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Break the problem down to understand it, get facts, and look for patterns in the workplace (gemba) until you get the direct cause.</li>
                            <li>Point of occurrence or the direct cause: here’s when we ask why as many times to get to the root cause, and then apply countermeasures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here’s the example given by Taiichi Ohno, the Toyota production father in the 1950s:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Why did the robot stop?</li>

                                <li>There was insufficient lubrication on the bearings, so they locked up.</li>

                                <li>The oil pump on the robot wasn’t circulating enough oil.</li>

                            <li><span style="color: red;">Who?</span> What roll do you want ChatGPT to play?</li>
                            <li><span style="color: orange;">What?</span> What exactly do you want to learn?</li>
                            <li><span style="color: green;">When?</span> What’s your time line? When do you want to learn?</li>
                            <li><span style="color: blue;">Where?</span> Do you prefer online courses? YouTube? Text-based courses?</li>
                            <li><span style="color: violet;">Why?</span> What’s your goal?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, let’s say you want to learn to code in Python for data science. This is the prompt (who, what, when, where, and why are linked by color):</p>
                        <p><em><span style="color: red;">Act as a coding tutor who creates study plans to help people learn to code.</span> You will be provided with the goal of the student, their time commitment, and resource preferences. You will create a study plan with time lines and links to resources. Only include relevant resources because time is limited. My first request is: <span style="color: violet;">I want to become a data scientist</span>, but I do not know how to code. <span style="color: green;">I can study 10 hours per week</span> and <span style="color: blue;">only want video resources.</span> <span style="color: orange;">I want to learn code in Python.</span> Create a study plan for me.</em></p>

                        <p>I asked it again for a study plan for projects like videogames and websites, and it gave the same plan except for weeks 7 to 10. Those are the topics for the latest four weeks:</p>

                        <p>I feel like I need some flavor to keep working with Python. I came to the conclusion that I need to apply my current knowledge to a project rather than just taking notes. I was trying to control an Arduino Uno with Python. But I was trying to use Python on Linux from a virtual machine in Windows, and it’s a bit messy for a beginner like me.</p>
                        <p>So I decided to pause this project and start a more fun one (and hopefully less stressful), and it seems <b>a snake game</b> will give me the motivation boost I’m looking for!</p>
                        <p>Alrighty!</p>
