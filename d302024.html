                        <p>Time flies when you’re having fun, as they say, and 2024 has been a busy but exciting year.</p>
                        <p>My plan for 2024 was to get back to my career, as I’m about to receive Canadian Permanent Residency after spending three years here, studying and working as a cook at The Narrow Lounge.</p>
                        <p>I started doing proper research and discovered that <a href="https://www.workbc.ca/research-labour-market/high-opportunity-occupations">digital technologies like Machine Learning and Digital Media are on the rise</a> in British Columbia. My portfolio was outdated, and I wanted to learn coding to transition into a Software Developer role, or perhaps something in between Design and Engineering.</p>

                        <h3 id="ux">UX Design Workshop and first project on Figma</h3>
                        <p>In february I attended a UX Design workshop hosted by BrainStation, where I learned what hiring managers are looking for in a designer and reviewed the Design Thinking method. I shared more details <a href="m142024.html">in this post.</a></p>
                        <p>With a better understanding of the current tools designers are using, I jumped straight into a project on Figma: <a href="https://brandonamaya.framer.ai/cherry-bum">The Plant identifier app.</a> It took me less than a month to go from sketches to the final design. Finally I have something new to add to my portfolio ✨.</p>
                        <h3 id="snake">The Snake Game</h3>
                        
                        <p>I was gaining confidence with my Python course, but I felt the need to start a project since it’s the best way to practice your knowledge. In the last days of April, I worked on a code-along Snake game project from YouTube.</p>
                        
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="sneak cover.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Cover for the game made in photoshop by me. Here's the link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOeBEYQRExM">video</a>.</p>
                            
                        </div>
                        <p>After finishing it, I made some changes to better fit my style, and now it’s available on <a href="https://github.com/BAmaya666">my GitHub account.</a> I wanted it to be playable for anyone I share the link with, so I considered creating a dedicated website for it. This idea led me to <em>start learning Web Design.</em></p>
                        <h3 id="pr">Responsive Web Design Certification and Canadian Permanent Residency</h3>
                        <p>By the end of April, I began a Responsive Web Design certification through FreeCodeCamp. During the course, I learned HTML and CSS and gained insight into Google Material Design and its visual design principles. I completed the certification by early June.</p>
                        <p>April also brought exciting news: after months of bureaucracy and <b>a lot of patience</b>, I received <em>my Canadian Permanent Residency</em>. This milestone allows me to work anywhere in Canada. As soon as I got the confirmation, I started sending my updated resume and cover letter to recruiters, eagerly awaiting opportunities</p>
                        <h3 id="job">A second job</h3>
                        <p>To reach a position in Tech, I need to learn how to code, build experience with projects, and stay consistent. This journey will take time and dedication, along with some courses that cost money. To support this, I decided to get a second job, preferably one related to design.</p>
                        <p>I quickly realized that the job market in British Columbia is highly competitive, and networking is essential. This led me to start looking for entry-level positions where I could work my way up.</p>
                        <p>While searching for roles like CAD Technician or Press Technician, I completed an AutoCAD certification through LinkedIn Learning in June.</p>

                        <p>I considered selling my art. I paint watercolor landscapes inspired by the beautiful scenes in British Columbia. I also have experience with screen printing and have used a 3D printer to create molds for funky ashtrays, and made stickers that I ended giving them to friends and family</p>

                        <p>After not hearing back from recruiters in August, I started wondering if my resume was missing something important. So, I reached out to an association in BC that helps immigrants build their lives in the province. They are assisting me with improving my resume and cover letter.</p>
                        <p>Through their support, I also got the opportunity to apply for a welding course at BCIT, starting next year. This will provide me with a stable career as I work toward becoming a software developer,perhaps even finding a way to combine my skills into something cool.</p>
                        <h3 id="latincouver">Volunteer at Latincouver</h3>
                        <p>In August, I became a volunteer at a nonprofit organization, Latincouver, assisting their Marketing department as a Web Designer. My role involves managing and updating their WordPress website. This experience has given me valuable insight into the responsibilities of a Web Designer and a glimpse into the day-to-day operations of a Canadian office environment. I continue to help them with the website, as it has been a great learning experience for me.</p>
                        <h3 id="framer">Portfolio on Framer</h3>
                        <p>I was researching tools to host my portfolio and discovered that Figma has a plugin that allows you to send your prototype to Framer, a no-code tool for building responsive websites. This means you can design your site in Figma and then send it to Framer to host your fully functional website.</p>
                        <p>After experimenting with both, I decided to start from scratch with Framer. Even though you don’t need to code, Framer has modules that structure the website. When you send the design from Figma, you need to adjust all the elements within these modules, so I found it easier to simply begin my designs directly in Framer, following its structure. I still use Figma, but only for visualizing my designs.</p>
                        <p>In the end, <a href="https://brandonamaya.framer.ai/">I hosted my portfolio on Framer</a>. This time, I wanted to highlight my thought process behind each project, including the research and the design thinking method.</p>
                        <h3 id="webDev">Web Development course</h3>
                        <p>I became pretty comfortable with Framer quickly, but I didn’t love the <em>huuuge button</em> that gets in the way of the website, or the fact that the domain includes “.framer.ai” after the website name. So, I decided to create an actual website using real code and host it on GitHub (until I’m more comfortable with my web design skills).</p>
                        <p>That’s why I started a Web Development course, and <b>I’m committed to sticking with it until I finish</b>. After gaining some experience with web design this year, I’m now able to better absorb the course material and apply it in real-time through <a href="https://bamaya666.github.io/Flynnty/">extra exercises I’m doing</a>.</p>
                        <h3 id="2025">2025</h3>
                        <p>Now that my career is moving forward again, I’ve gained a lot of knowledge that I’m excited to apply in 2025. My plan is still to land a designer job, continue learning HTML and CSS, and then focus on learning C. I’m interested in C because it provides insight into how computers work at a fundamental level, such as memory management, and its syntax and structure are similar to JavaScript and Python.</p>
