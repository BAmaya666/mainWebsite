                    <div class="script">
                        
                        <p>Last Thursday, on the 20th, I attended the Google Devfest 2025, organized by <a href="https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-vancouver/">the Google Developer Group in Vancouver.</a> The main organizers were Procheta Nag and Dinuka Gunaratne.</p>
                        <h3>First of all, here are some of the key concepts I learned ✨</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Framework / Library:</b> A pre-fabricated kit that provides a structured foundation for building software applications. It typically includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pre-written code for common tasks (like handling user input, managing files, or communicating with a database).</li>
                                    <li>A set of rules and conventions for code structure.</li>
                                    <li>o	Tools and libraries that make development faster and more consistent.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://react.dev/">React:</a></b> A <b>JavaScript library</b> (often referred to as a framework) for building user interfaces, primarily for websites.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native:</a></b> A <b>JavaScript framework</b> for building natively rendering <b>mobile applications</b> for iOS and Android.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Native App:</b> An application compiled into the native language of its platform (e.g., Objective-C/Swift for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android). This provides direct access to device features (camera, GPS, contacts) and delivers the performance and user experience of an app built specifically for that operating system.</li>

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo:</a></b>A <b>set of tools and services</b> built <em>around React Native</em> to streamline development, providing a smoother experience, especially for beginners and for building prototypes.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor:</a></b> An <b>AI-powered code editor</b> designed to help you write code faster using AI assistance.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase:</a></b> A Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform owned by Google that provides <b>ready-to-use cloud services</b>, eliminating the need to build your own server infrastructure from scratch.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://n8n.io/">N8n:</a></b> A workflow automation platform that combines AI capabilities to help you connect different apps and services, automating tasks without writing code. It is part of the "integration platform as a service" (iPaaS) ecosystem.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier:</a></b> A workflow automation platform similar to n8n. It enables users to connect web applications, automate tasks, and incorporate AI into their workflows.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI:</a></b> An AI agent that provides direct access to Gemini from your terminal.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/">Gemini Canvas:</a></b> A workspace within the Gemini app where users can create, edit, and refine documents and code with AI assistance.

                            <li><b><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">MCP (Model Context Protocol):</a></b> <b>An open-source standard</b> for connecting AI applications to external systems. It allows AIs like Claude or ChatGPT to connect to data sources (e.g., local files, databases), tools (e.g., search engines), and workflows, enabling them to access information and perform tasks.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Talks and Workshop</h3>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="devfest1.jpg" alt="">
                            
                        </div>
                        <p>The first talk focused on Gemini and its new features, such as Gemini CLI and Gemini Canvas. It was presented by Richard Seroter, a Senior Director at Google Cloud. He mentioned that Gemini Canvas is similar to ChatGPT apps, where you can use apps displayed inside the ChatGPT conversation and use them as an appendix of ChatGPT.</p>
                        <p>He also discussed <a href="https://antigravity.google/">Google Antigravity</a>, an ADK (Agent Development Kit) featuring an IDE (similar to the shell Editor in Google Cloud or VSCode). Its advantage is a CLI that understands natural language, functioning as if you are a project manager delegating tasks to autonomous software "agents."</p>
                        <p>Next, Taylor Stacey, a Senior AI Architect, explained how to build and deploy an ADK agent that uses an MCP inside Google Cloud—a process we later replicated in the workshop called Agentverse. He emphasized the importance of writing documentation throughout projects to improve collaboration and to reduce errors.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="devfest3.jpg" alt="">
                            
                        </div>
                        <p>Afterwards, Morten Rand-Hendriksen demonstrated how to connect any project with MCPs. He showed us how to connect Claude to Zapier and manipulate project data from the server using the MCP tool.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="devfest4.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>In this blurry picture we see the files and sites (like Wikipedia) where Claude is using to answer the user’ question.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/mor10/yvrdevfest2025">😉👉 Here’s the project to follow along and play with it.</a></p>
                        <p>In the second half, after lunch, we participated in <b>the Agentverse workshop</b>. Attendees were divided into four teams (Web Developers, DevOps Engineers, Data Engineers, and Architects) to build a project on Google Cloud. We used the terminal and Gemini to accelerate the development process.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="devfest5.jpg" alt="">
                            
                        </div>
                        <p>We coded <em>in Python</em>, a language I am not familiar with, but the workshop was structured so we could simply copy, paste, and follow instructions to see the project come to life. It was impressive to see how we could code, test everything in the cloud, and use Gemini to prompt the system.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="devfest6.jpg" alt="">
                            
                        </div>

                        <p>I must note that at one point, my code started looping, and Gemini began automatically updating, erasing, and rewriting values, likely due to a bug or a step I had skipped. However, since many others finished their projects successfully, it was probably the latter.</p>
                        <p>Between the coffee breaks and the networking lunch, I had the chance to talk with a diverse group of attendees. There were students seeking internships, senior engineers with years of experience, people from different careers who code for fun, and professionals who use AI to write code for their jobs.</p>
                        <p>One person told me he uses <b>Firebase</b> and was able to deploy nine apps in about a month. Similarly, some friends mentioned <b>Expo</b> and <b>React Native</b> as comparable frameworks.</p>
                        
                        <p>A very young woman mentioned she codes in any language using <b>Cursor</b> and that her team recently won first place in a hackathon.</p>
                        <p>Another attendee, a greenhouse manager, explained that he simply asks <b>Claude</b> or <b>ChatGPT</b> how to get a daily weather forecast message on his phone or how to create an AR program to spot crooked stems on his pepper crops.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>That day was <em>truly amazing</em>. Speaking with all those skilled individuals, for whom every conversation was a source of valuable knowledge, and realizing that my friends are brilliant in their fields, encouraged me to continue on this programming path. It was also overwhelming to encounter so much information that seems to be common knowledge, yet I was unaware of it. However, I am positive that tech knowledge is exponential— <em>it's a rabbit hole</em> where grasping one topic naturally leads you to the next.</p>
                        <p>My definitive takeaway is to learn AI, master it, and test and play with more tools. I will keep seeking out these kinds of events and communities, and volunteer if necessary. Earlier this year, I was experimenting with uncensored, portable LLMs, and for a long time, I've wanted to automate my house using an "ocarina" like in Zelda. This experience is my call to action to finally get my hands busy with these projects.</p>
