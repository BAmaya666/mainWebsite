This time, though, I listened to the audiobook this February and wrote keywords that I found important. Here they are ✨. (Plus important topics that I didn’t consider).</p>

                        <h3 id="human">Human-centred design</h3>
                        <p>Design based on human needs, activities, behaviors, and capabilities.</p>
                        <p>The communication from the machine to the human is key; <b>it should show clear feedback on what is happening and what the user can do with it (intuitive)</b>.</p>
                        <h3 id="innovation">Incremental innovations are better than radical innovations</h3>
                        
                        <p>While radical innovations may create new markets and capture attention, it’s the small, <b>incremental improvements that truly enhance the user experience and drive long-term success.</b></p>
                        <p>Designers can iteratively refine products or systems <b>based on user feedback and evolving needs.</b></p>
                        <h3 id="interaction">The principles of interaction</h3>
                        <p>Understanding potential ponits of failure in design and identifying patterns and root causes with the principles of interaction:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Affordance:</b> It should be clear how to use it unconsciously just by interacting with it, like a mug or a chair.</li>
                            <li><b>Signifiers:</b> Signs and labels. There was a story of some fake gas pipes blocking a secret entrance in a parking lot that just the people that work there knew the secret, and they drove over the pipes, folding them because they were made of rubber (a cool example of hiding the signifier just for the user: the workers).</li>
                            <li><b>Feedback:</b> Communicating the results of an action (BEEP! or so). <b>Clear and correctly</b>, oversaturating the product with lots of feedback might have a negative outcome.</li>
                            <li><b>Conceptual Models:</b> An explanation of how something works. People make conception models all the time, and it is the designer’s responsibility to help the user form a useful concept model with the product feedback (<b>the shape, signs, and even instructions</b>).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="gulfs">Gulfs of execution and evaluation</h3>
                        <p>When people interact with a product, two sources of difficulty may appear: <b>the lack of discoverability</b> or the lack of execution (not knowing what to do) and <b>the lack of feedback</b> or the gulf of evaluation (not knowing what happened) from the product.</p>
                        <p><em><b>Empathizing</b></em> with the user is the goal for the designer. What do I want to accomplish? This is the question the user asks to define their goal.</p>
                        <p>What are my alternatives? What can I do now? And how do I do it? are questions users ask when they try to figure out how to execute.</p>
                        <p>Have I accomplished my goal? What does it mean? What happened? are questions the users ask when they’re trying to determine what happened in response to an action taken.</p>
                        <h3 id="stages">The 7 Stages of an Action</h3>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="seven stages.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Form <em>the goal.</em></li>
                            <li>Plan the action.</li>
                            <li>Specify a sequence of actions.</li>
                            <li>Execute the sequence of actions.</li>
                            <li>Percive the outcome.</li>
                            <li>Interpret the outcome (What happened exactly?)</li>
                            <li>Evaluate the outcome (Did it happened what I was intended to happen?)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Note that typical human behavior isn’t going through all stages in a linear way, and also that not all seven stages are conscious, but the seven stages provide a helpful checklist for designers when create or re-create something (to improve usability, e.g., <b>help the user not to think too much when interacting with the product</b>).</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="why">5 Whys</h3>
                        <p><b>Root-cause analysis</b> helps to find the main reason for a situation that might seem clear but has a deeper, more complex underlying cause.</p>
                        <p>With this analysis, you have to break the problem down into facts and find patterns (point of occurrence), then start asking why until you get to the root cause to assess and fix. Here’s an example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Problem: The car won’t start.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Why? The battery is dead.</li>
                                    <li>Why? The lights stayed on overnight.</li>
                                    <li>Why? The driver forgot to turn them off.</li>
                                    <li>Why? They were distracted by their phone.</li>
                                    <li>Why? They were in a rush to attend a videocall.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The main issue got traced back to the root cause, and now we can implement solutions such as a mental check-up protocol when getting out of the car or planning ahead to have enough time for attending meetings.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="root">Design thinking doesn’t fix the problem, but the root of the problem</h3>
                        <p>Design thinking involves <em>finding the real problem, not the symptom</em>, and then, after issuing the constraints, finding the right solution. And <b>the Double Diamond model</b> approaches problems in the right fashion.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="double diamond.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p><b>Observation.</b> Research to understand the nature of the problem, <b>empathizing with the user,</b> their motivation, and their true needs. Insights from individuals and purchasing data from large groups.</p>
                        <p><b>Idea generation.</b> Identifying potential solutions, brainstorming, and crazy and creative ideas are welcome.</p>
                        <p><b>Prototyping.</b> Make prototypes to understand the idea. If the target population is using something related to the new product, that can be considered a prototype.</p>
                        <p><b>Testing.</b> Validation comes when the prototype is tested with the real user, bridging the gap between what people claim they need and what they actually require.</p>
                        <p><em>“Requirements produced by asking people what they need are invariably wrong. <b>Requirements are developed by watching people in their natural environment.</b>”</em></p>
                        <p>And <b>iterate it</b>. Tests and modifications lead to improvement. Failures should be seen as learning experiences.</p>
                        <p><b>Let the activities define the product</b>(e.g., grocery shopping, a group of tasks), not the target user or tasks.</p>
                        <h3 id="universal">Universal design</h3>
                        

                        <p>Good design should be a design for everyone can use it and understand it by the majority of people regardless their size and habilites.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some examples:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Zero-step entrances to buildings.</li>
                                    <li>Handles instead of knobs.</li>
                                    <li>Crossing signals that can be both heard and seen.</li>
                                    <li>Curb cuts, ramps, and wide sidewalks for wheelchairs and strollers.</li>
