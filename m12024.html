                        <h3 id="uxui">UX and UI</h3>
                        <p>I was working on a project on Figma at work, and a friend approached and asked what I was doing. I show the app I’m working on, and he says: Are you learning UI? My roommate is fixing some issues on an app right now, and he’s having a hard time. Lots of coding.</p>
                        
                        <p>At that time, I wasn’t 100% sure of the differences between user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). User Experience is the flow of the user experience interacting with a product, how do they feel about the product/ service, Does the navigation feel logical? Does the app psyched the user? that kind of thing. And the User Interface is the effective operation of the machine from the human end, ideally easy to operate (user-friendly) to get the desired result. UI is the aesthetic approach, interface, animations, buttons, and such. Apparently my friend’s roommate is a software developer, haha, but it’s understandable since these fields work together.</p>

                        <p><b><a href="https://ajsmart.com/">AJ&Smart</a></b> is a design studio based in Berlin that focuses on <a href="https://www.workshopper.com/">workshops</a> and facilitation (leadership?) and they have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeB_OpLspKJGiKv1CYkWFFw">YouTube channel</a> that talks about UX design, product design, design sprints, and product strategies. I started to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aCoqXKFOU&list=PLxk9zj3EDi0WG8jU6-RI4GnL4l7Oz0Jhg">How to get started in UX</a> playlist to — well —, get started in UX. I’ve found it very helpful. It has tons of tools and resources from which anyone can benefit. Like in the last video I watched, they came up with free courses online to learn UX and UI.

                        <h3 id="canvas">The canvas strategy by Ryan Holiday</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://ryanholiday.net/the-canvas-strategy/">The canvas strategy</a> is a concept about getting what you want by learning how to get other people what they want. <em>“Find canvases for other people to paint on."</em></p>
                        <p>This strategy is claimed to be a great way to get a job in UX, and it has three steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Know where you are in the food chain: at the very bottom.</li>
                            <li>Research what the people/ customer want (for example, do research on the company you want to work for, what, where, when, and so forth).</li>
                            <li>Do it (based on these keys):</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create attention from that company by finding new trains of thought to hand over for them to explore and <b>contact them</b> with ideas (well presented, <b>show them how you work</b> and doing that you are already ahead in the ladder; besides, it can give you experience for yourself and you can add it to your portfolio).</li>
                                <li>Find people, associations, and connections for the company (and for you, of course).</li>
                                <li>Find inefficiencies, redundancies, and waste in company processes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 id="industry">The “industry standard” tools AJ&Smart use</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Figma</b> seems to be the software that is widely used in UX (I even heard at a UX workshop that Sketch is over). It’s a prototyping tool that they use on a weekly basis to <b>prototype quickly</b> for their clients. They used sketch, but sketch has more requirements to collaborate in real time with others. You can make team libraries of UI elements, plus you can use Figma on your browser, which is good for the clients if they need to collaborate.</li>
                            <li><b><a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel.</a></b> Figma doesn’t have <b>built-in animation</b>, but they import files from Figma and import them into Marvel. The animations make the prototype feel real with the common interaction between the user and the app.</li>
                            <li><b>Miro</b> is a visual workspace to facilitate communication (like <b>an actual whiteboard</b>) with remote teammates and manage projects. Before, they used to record the feedback on post-its, and then they transferred it to digital. Now, the user can post their feedback right away on Miro, and the client can follow it and be on the same page, which creates a more collaborative environment with the product test.</li>
                            <li><b>Appear.in and Loom.Appear.In</b> it’s like Google Hangouts but “better” to record meetings, and loom is the backup, automatically uploading the meeting as it’s been recorded.</li>
                            <li><b>Basecamp.</b> A project management tool to gather all email from a specific topic in one place, delegate activities, share files, have real-time chat, and check the progress of projects for a specific team.</li>
                            <li><b>Slack.</b> A communication tool broadly used by the studio. They share all kinds of content that the team might find useful or entertaining, usually posts from Instagram.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 id="network">How to build your network</h3>
                        <p>That means meeting real people in person through Meetup, volunteering, and looking on social media or at venues for congresses and bootcamps. <b>UX is a people-focused field, so it’s necessary to force yourself to approach people, having topics of conversation and things that you can offer to start conversations. It is a must to learn how to engage with people in this career.</b></p>
                        <p>I’m trying to attend at least one event per month, and the last one I did at Brainstation (Intro day: UX design) was very nurturing. Every person I talked to had an interesting background and shared some tips and points of view to consider in my projects. It also helped me with my social skills.</p>
                        <p>Another way to get involved with designers and experts is to volunteer to give a talk about something you  know. Contact the organizers of events. Maybe give a talk about a program that you took or knowledge from another field. You don’t need to be an expert on the topic as long as it’s interesting to people; practice it and get your face out as someone who knows stuff!</p>

                        <h3 id="employers">What employers are looking for</h3>
                        <p>Use your current job (taco cat, formerly known as taco ding dong) to put into practice your knowledge of design thinking to solve a problem, analyze the cause, ask coworkers, do research, make prototypes, and even showcase it in your portfolio.</p>
                        <p>My current job is in the kitchen of a dive bar, and most of the appliances are older than me or bought from a thrift store. When there’s a major issue like not working fridges, pests, or leaking pipes, I have to call my boss, but there are some quirk situations and lesser issues that I fight myself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sometimes, when we needed to run food for a large group of people, we used to carry the orders, juggling them. Now we started to <b>use baking trays as the transport for multiple baskets.</b> No need to buy new items.</li>
                            <li>The popcorn machine stopped working, and I bought a “new” machine (from a thrift store), but the machine threw the seeds before they popped, so I started moving the machine in angles to keep the seeds inside until they popped, and after finding the right angle, I made a cardboard surface for it. <b>Now the popcorn comes with no seeds.</b></li>
                            <li>For safety protocols, we need to keep temperature records, and the ones we have are standard forms that don’t fit with our fridges. <b>I made a temperature records sheet in Illustrator</b> right for our fridges and added columns that make sense with their needs, like the chlorine levels in the washing machine one. No sweat.</li>
                            <li>Once in a while, I have to train new people, showing them the kitchen and how to make our dishes. We as humans can’t remember everything when there’s a lot of information, so I made <b>a guide to build up our food as a backup for the new staff.</b></li>
                            <li>I have no intention of making a career in the hospitality field, but I want to leave <b>a guide on how to handle the duties in the kitchen</b> where we currently work. Budget, suppliers, item management, and such.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>While you are looking for a UX job, <b>a personal project</b> can be <b>a great way to learn and show your skills, the way you think, and the way you work:</b> issue the challenge, the goals, and processes like mockups, sketches, and prototypes, and add them to your portfolio. </p>
                        <p>Recently, I made <b><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1373563865340422682/cherry-bum-plant-identifier">my first project on Figma</a></b>, an app to identify edible and medicinal plants in Canada. I’ll make a post about it next.</p>

                        <p>It doesn’t need to be huge; what is important is <b>your thought process, how you solve problems</b>, and what you can you offer as your core triats (processes, concepts, photos, and what softwares you use). Tell a story about who you are as a designer.</p>
                        <p>As to reaching companies, look for companies that you are interested in and try <b>send them a cold email</b>, tell them who you are, and show them your portfolio. Reach out to the right person (e.g., the head of the design department) and look out for guides on how to write a cold email. Keep in mind to use the right language and mirror the way this person writes or talks.</p>
                        <p>A good and short book on how to speak the same language as your client is <em>“Design is a Job”</em> by Mike Monteiro. The chapter 7, “Presenting your work” has lots of tips that came in handy.</p>
