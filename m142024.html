                        <h2>Brainstation workshop: Intro day</h2>
                        <p>March 14, 2024</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="script">
                        
                        <p>I recently went to a workshop with experts currently working in their fields, so their knowledge and expertise are highly valuable. The workshop was divided into three parts: what companies are looking for in their job applicants portfolios, a UX exercise, and the testimony of Brainstation’s former students, now heads of design or software development in their companies.</p>
                        <p>In the first part, they talk about what the hiring managers see when they’re looking for designers: what they see in their portfolio, like <b>soft skills and transferable skills</b> (skills, hobbies and experiences), like communication, collaboration, and problem solving. <b>Storytell your portfolio and show critical thinking.</b> Avoid using ChatGPT for making your resume and portfolio; they can tell by the way it writes.</p>
                        <p>Do proper research for the company you want to apply to, do it thoroughly, and once you get the interview, ask honest questions and be modest.</p>
                        <p>Also, <b>referrals are the main source from which they get new employees, so make new contacts, <em>expand your network</em>, and keep sharing projects and such on social media.</b></p>
                        <p>Professions for a UX designer:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>User Researcher</li>
                            <li>Information Architect (IA)</li>
                            <li>Interaction Designer (IxD)</li>
                            <li>Visual Designer (UI)</li>
                            <li>UX Copywriter</li>
                            <li>UX Designer/Architect/Analyst</li>
                            <li>Product Designer (UX/UI)</li>
                            <li>Project Manager</li>
                            <li>Front-end Developer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Then, for the project, we met two heads of design in their companies, leading the project “Get Fresh Produce.” We had to solve the problem with design thinking, and the user was our team partner.</p>

                        <p><b>Empathize/Discover</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Here’s when you do extensive <b>research</b> about the user and the problem, asking open <b>questions</b> to the user to then define the problem statement, which is the issue your user is currently facing.</li>
                            <li>To build this statement using the <b>needs, goals, and pain points</b> identified in the user’s issue.</li>
                            <li>In this exercise, your partner’s goals and needs relate to their grocery shopping habits and their lives. Pain points are areas of frustation your parnter may have experienced when purchasing fresh produce in the past. for example:</li><ul>
                                <li><em>Goals:</em> Partner wants to purchase organic produce in order to stay healthy.</li>
                                <li><em>Needs:</em> Partner needs the ability to purchase the produce they need in one place so they don’t have to make multiple trips to farmer’s markets.</li>
                                <li><em>Pain points:</em> Partner finds it difficult to purchase the correct amount of produce, leading to food going to waste.Pain points: Partner finds it difficult to purchase the correct amount of produce, leading to food going to waste.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Define</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this step, you need to reflect on all the data you gathered from the previous one to define the problem statement.</li>
                            <li>Here, we organize all the information collected from the user, labeling it and presenting it effectively to understand the whole picture (<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-architecture?srsltid=AfmBOorLcOTBSkBmjD7oAV3gI1gJ6bUhINYqMg4BBc8XYnK_HD2fmfuu#what_is_information_architecture_(ia)?-0">information architecture</a>).</li>
                            <li>We can make assumptions, create stories of how the user interacts with the product or service and create a <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/user-experience-mapping/what-is-user-experience-mapping/#:~:text=User%20Experience%20Mapping%20uses%20storytelling,total%20experience%20of%20the%20customer."><b>user experience map</b></a>. Where does their journey begin? What’s their first point of interaction with the product? What actions and steps do they take to reach their end goal? How do they feel at each stage? </li>
                            <li>The point of the <b>problem statement</b> is to be at the center of your thinking as you move through the process. <b>Always refer back to your problem statement when making any and all decisions.</b> For example, after defining the goals, needs, and pain point:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Overall, the inconvenience of traveling to multiple farmer markets for organic produce makes it difficult to purchase the groceries I need each week.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><b>Define the problem, not the solution</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Ideate/Develop</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brainstorm ideas from traditional to radical; make wireframe sketches and lo-fi mockups.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Test/Deliver</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This step is about experimenting with ideas to see which ones work and which ones don’t. Reflect, evaluate the results, and iterate through previous phases until you find a successful solution.</li>
                            <li>Design thinking is a nonlinear, iterative process.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They also mentioned the <a href="https://gamestorming.com/impact-effort-matrix-2/">impact vs. effort matrix</a> and <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-happy-path-in-ux-design/#:~:text=smoother%20design%20handoffs-,What%20is%20a%20Happy%20Path%20in%20UX%20Design%3F,to%20make%20users%20feel%20happy.">the happy path.</a></p>
                        <p>In the last part, we had a Q&A session after the speakers told us about studying at Brainstation and then getting a job in their fields (web development and user experience design).</p>
                        <p><a href="https://dianapechar.com/">Diana Pechar</a>, a Senior in Product Design at <a href="https://roofr.com/">Roofr</a>, also mentions that hiring managers look for <b>soft skills in your portfolio</b> (how you approach issues, define problems, and such). And the <b>importance of cold emails</b>. She said everyone likes to talk about themselves, so don’t hesitate to <b>ask for feedback from designers and seniors. That will also make them notice you. And it is very important to keep expand your networking.</b></p>
