                        <p>So, in regards to being more professional and more acute with the professional environment I want to be in, I was checking the job websites like Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, and the Canadian Job Bank for industrial designer jobs. I haven’t worked in the field for 3 or 4 years now, and when I checked the positions available, I noticed that the industry (at least in Vancouver, Canada) is more inclined toward digital design (UX/UI).</p>

                        <p>I decided to check for AI tools like <em>ChatGPT</em> to help me with productivity and to keep myself updated.</p>
                        
                        <p>I found some useful websites like <em>Perplexity, Canva, Dalle or Genie</em> for my current projects,but I bet I can find more interesting attributes in more AI tools during the process. Here are the ones I found (all can be used for free):</p>

                        <h3 id="figma">Figma</h3>
                        
                        <p>I found that if I want to join the UX/UI field, I have to know Figma. Figma is a cloud-based design tool used to create user interfaces, websites, mobile applications, etcetera (it’s like Illustrator and Google Slides combined). As far as I know, <b>Figma is just the visual part of the project</b>, like the storyboard of the user experience. With the addition of real-time collaboration, making it ideal for remote teams. Also, it has a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community">community</a> where you can see other people’s projects, download icons, templates, and such.</p>
                        <p>I’m watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aCoqXKFOU&list=PLxk9zj3EDi0WG8jU6-RI4GnL4l7Oz0Jhg">a course</a> to learn how to use Figma properly, and it seems easy to use, but what I like the most about it is the expertise of the designers. They mentioned the human interface guidelines of Apple and Android for good design to take into consideration for the design of a product.</p>
                        <p>Also, that it is important to gather <a href="https://userexperiencedesign.slack.com/">a community</a> to touch base, get feedback, and get inspiration from fellow designers.</p>
                        <p>They also mention that jobs are looking for well-documented projects in a designer’s portfolio. Clear documentation not only demonstrates your skills but also showcases your professionalism and attention to detail. It can be a valuable asset when seeking new clients or job opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Equally, a great way to get the perfect job for you is to look at what that job is actually looking for and dwell on those aspects (like Figma, Python, and so on).</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The design of everyday things from Don Norman, a classic that is always good to re-read.</li>
                            <li>Don’t make me think from Steve Krug</li>
                            <li>Sprint from Jake Knapp</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>And on top of that, as I see it, it is necessary to set deadlines for your projects. Spread the projects on blocks to work on and set deadlines for those blocks. <b><em>This can also be applied on one's life</em></b></p>

                            <p>What are Python *args? – Tamara Shatar 2021</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In 2021, I was feeling unsure about the path I was taking in the product design industry in Mexico (and because the current populist government is alarmingly ridiculous), so I started considering learning a new skill that I can work anywhere in the world (remotely), that is well paid, and that will be in demand in the future (although the future in the world is foggy with AI). I took programming into consideration; I was amazed by domotics and Arduino back in university. I’m pretty sure I actively looked for a programming course, but there’s a chance the algorithm on Instagram or Youtube offered it to me.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, I started to take an online HTML and Javascript course, but because I didn’t set a routine to study (at the beginning, I was studying daily, but as time passed, I did it less often), and because I found it challenging (I faced some problems that I couldn’t figure out myself, and coding was a total alien topic to me), it made it harder to follow, plus I wasn’t taking any notes. It got to a point where it was very hard, and I decided to start again a year later, taking notes this time!</p>
                        
                        <p>My partner (who is a software developer) pointed out that I should learn coding in English instead of Spanish (the course is in Spanish), because that’s how the commands are written originally, and if I wanted to work for a company (in the global north), everything would be in English. Also, he mentioned that Python is the easiest programming language to learn since it is a language similar to English (structurally speaking), so I gave it a shot.</p>
                        <p>I found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/">The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp course</a> by Colt Steele on Udemy, and it is easy to follow. Also,  with my brief experience with HTML and Javascript, I felt more comfortable coding on it. I started using a virtual machine with Linux (my partner told me that’s where most of the software developers program). At the beginning, he installed it on my computer, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and do everything else by myself (Oh my!), so I started to play with this new operating system, and I was trying to give more RAM to the virtual machine, but I messed up and I needed to reinstall it. The screen of the VM looked small, so I had to play with the virtual guest CD image, and it was frustrating, but I figured it out. Also, apparently Linux does everything with commands in its terminal, so I’m learning a lot from the whole situation.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">

                            <p>"Maquina del Tiempo" repository on GitHub</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>My partner saw my clear interest in learning Python, and he suggested that it would be handy if I applied my current knowledge to an actual project, so he gave me Maquina del Tiempo, which is to create a LED digital clock using Arduino Uno. So I did my research, and Arduino just works with C++. I have no idea how to work with that language <em>(yet)</em>, but Arduino has preset code for certain situations, and I played with it and it worked! But I wanted to program it in Python. There’s some ways to combine them, and guess what? My partner already had <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/">a microcontroller for Python</a>, so I’m going to work with it. And funny thing, by the time I’m writing this, I’m learning how to use Python packages to do stuff like code on Arduino, access the internet, and much more.</p>
                        <p>Now that I have the useful notes that I wrote, I’m a bit ahead of the other half of the course because I’ve been more consistent in my classes, plus after talking with my partner and friends and searching on Youtube and Reddit, I have a more broad idea of what I can do with this knowledge, like using it to apply for a job as a quality assurance assistance analyst in the short term, automating my house and applications, mixing it with SQL (which is in my plans, though I still need to do more research), or even making videogames in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> or <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">Sandbox.</a> I’m so excited!</p>

                        <h3 id="february">February ’24 plan</h3>
                        <p>The first week of February was to get myself ready by doing some research, investigating what employers are looking for, meditating on what job I want to do on a regular basis (and being paid generously), how I can get it with my current resources, and what areas I can improve. I came up with this plan (broken down):</p>
                        <p>In the first week, I decided to get through a UX course (just 5 hours, 22 minutes) to get started, and it seems Figma will be the program to make my first UX project to show in my updated portfolio by the end of February. As I mentioned before, it pointed out to start documenting my work, and this is the outcome, as well as to set deadlines, and so far it’s been working smoothly.</p>
                        <p>The second week I’ll work on the UX project, the third I’ll assess my portfolio and make it better (I have a project that I want to redo already, so that will be the main task here), and in the fourth week I’ll work on the final details in addition to my resume and my cover letter. I’ll be studying Python still, parallel to all this.</p>
