                        <h3>The Story</h3>
                        <p>By the beginning of 2024 I decided to get started on coding and UX, but I hadn’t had any idea of which project I could develop. A game maybe?</p>
                        <p>It was until one morning in March, when my boyfriend and I were walking around the neighborhood looking at the plants in the gardens. So many! Some started to show fruits and berries, some smelled delicious, but I couldn’t name any.</p>
                        <p>I was already aware of the rich diversity of plants in British Columbia since the day I moved here, and I got a book, <em>“Edible and Medicinal Plants of Canada”</em>, to carry around. But the reality is that it’s a chunky book that adds a lot of weight to my bag, so it’s lying beautifully in the bookshelf at home.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, I took some pictures of the plants to identify them with Google Lens, but the experience was slow, vague, and disappointing.</p>
                        <p>That’s when everything clicked, and I saw this situation as an opportunity to tackle it with design ✨.</p>
                        <p>I just started to do sketches on paper, how I like it to behave and what it should do. So I looked into the book, how it’s structured, and see if I can standardize its content for the app.</p>
                        <p><b>It felt like the app was building itself; everything flowed naturally:</b></p>
                        
                        <p>You just want to eliminate friction in your experience <em>identifying a plant</em>, so I thought of Shazam (the music identifier app), and once you know its name and what it does, maybe you want to <em>save that info in your profile</em> and maybe pin it (like in Google Maps), so <em>people also interested in this topic</em> can see the plant in the app map. Maybe they want to meet people with the same interests and create a community (like Discord) and maybe even meet in real life (MeetUp).</p>
                        
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="render cover cherry bum.jpg" alt="">
                            
                            
                        </div>
                        <p>So after gathering all the ideas for my app, I made up a user journey and started designing the app on Figma. Finally finish my first project on Figma by the end of March.</p>
                        <h3>The Name</h3>
                        <p>When I was thinking of a name, I wanted to give it a name that sounds like a term of endearment but with fruits, like <em>“sweet pea”</em> or <em>“pumpkin pie.”</em></p>
                        <p>Lost in translation, I thought cherry bum was also a common nickname (it was <em>honey bun</em> haha), and my boyfriend mentioned that that’s the name of the vegan restaurant in Commercial Drive (<em>My Sweet Cherubim</em>) that we go to often, but we can never say its name correctly. We laugh, and I decided to name it Cherry Bum as it links the app with Vancouver East Side more.</p>
                        
                        <p>A friend even thought of fireworks (cherry bomb) when I told him about it. That gave me ideas for the mascot: a fruit with an explosive but sweet personality.</p>
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="jolly cherry3.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <h3>What does it do</h3>
                        <p>Essentially, you <b>take a picture of the plant</b>, berry, or bush you want to identify with the app, and <b>it tells you its name and the description</b> (if it’s edible, if the native people used it for such and such, if it’s poisonous, its medicinal uses, etc.).</p>
                        <p>If you want to go beyond, you can sign up and help <b>the community</b> to grow its data: <b>you can see a map with all the pins other users left, events happening near you, forums, and your profile with a list of the pins you pinned</b>, the events you are going to and your direct messages (oh yeah!) with fellow plant enthusiasts.</p>
                        
                        <p>It stopped there until September when I started to update my professional portfolio, and for this time I knew that to get my feet wet in the industry I have to make it on my own website and that I have to show my thought process more emphatically (I will talk more profoundly about it in my next post), and for now I published it on Framer, which is a tool to make responsive websites without coding, and also Figma has a plug-in to move your prototype to Framer and make it responsive.</p>
                        
                        <p>Please check my Cherry Bum project on <a href="https://brandonamaya.framer.ai/cherry-bum">my portfolio here.</a> It has the actual research and design thinking.</p>
