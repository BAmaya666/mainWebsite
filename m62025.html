                        <p>March 6, 2025</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="script">
                        
                        <p>Recently, I was listening the podcast "The Outlaw Ocean," which talks about the crimes committed in open oceans and the waters of developing countries, such as slavery, overfishing, and waste dumping. These kinds of actions kill ecosystems and living beings, which are part of a larger scheme that makes everything polluted and hardens the situation for poor people.</p>
                        
                        <div class="headScript">
                            <img src="outlaw ocean.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Photo taken by Fabio Nascimento from The Outlaw Ocean.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>On the other hand, though, there are heroes fighting for good causes. For example, <a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/">Women on Waves</a>, an association that helps women in countries where beliefs take precedence over the health of citizens, by providing abortions on open waters, navigating laws, and evading religious groups and such.</p>
                        <p>Then there is <a href="https://seashepherd.org/">the Sea Shepherds</a>, a branch of Greenpeace that protects marine wildlife. <em>"It takes a pirate to catch a pirate,"</em> they say, as they chase ships involved in illegal fishing, giving them a hard time and eventually stopping them to hand them over to the authorities.</p>
                        <p>These thoughtful efforts touch my heart and inspire me to work for bigger causes. To be honest, the massive pollution in the world and how people give themselves to overconsumption makes me sick.</p><p>That, and also I've been looking to start a life project on something that I'd truly care about.</p>
                        <p>Currently, I'm working at Canada Mats as a production worker, seeking to grow professionally in the manufacturing sector. And I’ve noticed an opportunity area regarding material waste: lots of cutouts from the mats (mostly rubber) end up in the trash, and it costs the company a lot of money to dispose of it. I thought, <em>why not turn this waste into new materials and take this burden off the company?</em></p>
                        <p>To get this project moving, I’ll need some tools: <b>Transportation</b>, like a pickup truck or a van <em>(which would also be great for long road trips and camping)</em>. <b>Machines</b>, primarily a shredder to reduce the materials to crumbs and an extrusion machine to melt them into 3D printer filaments or press them into molds to create blocks for furniture or clothing. Some <b>welding skills</b> would also come in handy to build machines myself instead of buying them, and it would be great to customize my own production line! Of course, I’d also need <b>space</b>—a lot of it—to store the plastic before and after processing, as well as an area for the machines.</p>
                        
                        <div class="headScript">

                            <p>Rubber tiles made by Freee Recycle</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>It would be amazing to reach the level of <a href="https://freee-recycle.com/ng/">Free Recycle</a>, a company in Nigeria founded by Ifedolapo Runsewe. They collect used tires from the streets and recycle them into products like spongy tiles for playgrounds, slippers, and more.</p>
                        
                        <div class="headScript">

                        </div>
                        <p>I’d also love to connect with <a href="https://www.onearmy.earth/">One Army</a>, a wonderful group of people working for a better world by addressing important issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            
                            <li>They lead <a href="https://www.preciousplastic.com/">Precious Plastic</a>, a community focused on recycling plastic that provides resources to start a business and spread the movement (this is where I learned about the machines and processes for recycling plastic).</li>
                            <li>They also run <a href="https://projectkamp.com/">Project Kamp</a>, an experimental community in the beautiful Portugal’s countryside, that hosts people with backgrounds in design, engineering, cooking, communication, and science (like botanists and arborists) to explore ways to live in harmony with the environment.</li>
                            <li>Another initiative, <a href="https://fixing.fashion/">Fixing Fashion</a>, offers tutorials on repairing and recreating clothes to challenge the wasteful fashion industry, which consumes vast amounts of materials and energy.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.onearmy.earth/project/phonebloks">Phonebloks</a>, a concept to reduce electronic waste with modular phones where you can replace components like the camera, screen, or speaker instead of buying a new phone. Although the project didn’t take off, the idea lives on. </li>
                            <li>They also have <a href="https://www.onearmy.earth/project/story-hopper">Story Hopper</a>, a series of videos about the consequences of shallow lifestyles and alternatives to live more kindly with the world and its living beings.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This whole project will take time to bloom, but the seed is planted. In the summer I will take my driving test, so I can get my Novice driver license. Once I have that, I can buy my car as the first step toward this project. Then buy a motor for the shredder and maybe build it. </p>

                        <p>For now I'll be doing research on how to treat plastics and how to start a recycling project that doesn't necessarily need to be recycling plastic, but to reuse material. I will look into how to build the machines; maybe I'll buy a welding machine and focus on this area. Also, I consider very important to join a class or a workshop, so I can hang out with like-minded people that can share their knowledge with me.</p>
                        <p>There’s a lot to learn and people to meet, but I’m sure the dots will connect seamlessly, and I’m very excited to experience it.</p>
